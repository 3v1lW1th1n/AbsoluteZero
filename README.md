# AbsoluteZero
Python APT Backdoor

#To ozzie_offsec:

Add a '__ini__.py' file in each folder or the compiler will not find the scripts.

I've used python 2.7 and for addictional modules just check out what the compiler is missing and install them via pip.

I remember that i used:
colorama
tabulate
shutil
tempfile
pyCrypto

If you have any trouble let me know
